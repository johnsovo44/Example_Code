Prior to execution you need to install this: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/ . Necessary to open and \"Drive\" the chrome web browser. Each browser has its own driver (basically a program to move through a website programmatically is my understanding of a driver). This should be saved in the same location as the python script/notebook to really work. "
